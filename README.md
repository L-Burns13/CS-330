CS 330 Portfolio Reflection: Computational Graphics and Visualization

-How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by first identifying the problem and constraints, then breaking the solution into smaller, manageable components. For this project, I focused on designing a scene that balanced visual accuracy with technical feasibility. I selected objects that could be built from basic shapes so I could concentrate on transformations, textures, lighting, and camera behavior rather than complex geometry.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of modular design. Separating responsibilities such as transformations, texture application, lighting, and camera control made the code easier to understand and adjust. I also developed a stronger sense of how visual design choices directly relate to technical implementation.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I began with a reference image and identified the objects and shapes needed to recreate the scene. I then implemented each object incrementally, adjusting scale, position, and materials before moving on to the next. Lighting and camera controls were refined after the scene layout was complete to improve realism and usability.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Breaking problems into smaller components and prioritizing clarity can be applied to any software project. The focus on modular design and incremental improvement will be useful in future courses and professional development, even outside of graphics-focused work.

-How do I approach developing programs?
I develop programs iteratively, testing frequently and making small adjustments rather than large changes all at once. This helps reduce errors and makes it easier to understand how individual changes affect the final result.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I learned to work more deliberately with transformations, texture layering, transparency, and camera controls. I also gained experience debugging visual issues by adjusting parameters and observing how the scene responded in real time.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential throughout the project. Object placement, texture scaling, lighting intensity, and camera behavior were all refined through repeated testing and adjustment. Each milestone helped guide improvements toward the final scene.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
Over the course of the milestones, I became more intentional about organizing code and reusing functions. I developed a better understanding of cause-and-effect relationships in code, especially when working with rendering, lighting, and camera movement.

-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me tools to create structured, logical solutions while still allowing room for creativity. It supports my goal of pursuing software engineering by strengthening problem-solving skills and technical confidence.

How do computational graphics and visualizations apply to my future educational pathway?
This course expanded my understanding of how code can directly control visual outcomes. The skills learned here support future coursework by reinforcing concepts such as modular design, abstraction, and iterative development.

How do computational graphics and visualizations apply to my future professional pathway?
Although I do not plan to work in game design or simulation, the skills from this course are valuable in software engineering roles. Understanding how systems interact visually and programmatically improves my ability to design clear, maintainable, and user-focused software.
